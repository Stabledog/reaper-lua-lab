# Some questions as I learn Reaper, starting from an extensive background with Ableton live

As you transition from Ableton Live to Reaper, here are some key points to consider:

## Interface and Workflow

- Reaper's interface is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your preferences[^1_1]. You can set up keyboard shortcuts and mouse behaviors similar to Ableton to ease the transition[^1_5].
- Reaper uses a more traditional linear timeline compared to Ableton's dual Session/Arrangement views[^1_1]. This may take some adjustment, but offers flexibility for editing and arranging.
- Reaper excels in customization through scripts and extensions, allowing you to create powerful custom workflows[^1_6].


## Key Features

- **Routing Flexibility**: Reaper offers extensive routing options and unlimited sends/returns, surpassing Ableton in this area[^1_9].
- **Resource Efficiency**: Many users find Reaper more CPU-efficient and stable compared to Ableton, especially for large projects[^1_9].
- **MIDI Editing**: While different from Ableton, Reaper's MIDI editing capabilities are powerful once you learn them[^1_8].
- **Mixing Tools**: Reaper provides robust mixing features like track folders and flexible grouping options[^1_8].


## Transitioning Tips

1. Install SWS Extensions to greatly expand Reaper's functionality[^1_6].
2. Explore custom actions and scripts to streamline your workflow[^1_7].
3. Utilize track templates and FX chains to speed up your process[^1_7].
4. Learn to use regions and markers for efficient arrangement[^1_7].
5. Consider using ReWire to integrate Ableton Live with Reaper if needed[^1_10].

## Live Looping and Performance

While Reaper wasn't built around loops like Ableton, there are community-developed solutions:

- Playtime extension offers clip-launching functionality similar to Ableton[^1_6].
- For complex live looping, some users run Ableton as a slave to Reaper using Reablink and Jack 2[^1_6].

Remember, the transition may take time, but many users find Reaper's flexibility and efficiency worth the learning curve[^1_9]. Focus on customizing Reaper to fit your workflow, and you'll likely discover new, powerful ways of working that weren't possible in Ableton.

# This video walks us through setting up vscode to debug reaper lua scripts.  I think I'm 90% done, but reaper throws an error running my script, complaining that `mobdebug` module can't be found.

I don't see where in the video the speaker is setting up mobdebug in such a way that the lua in reaper would be able to find it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAMQXGMHl2M\&ab_channel=D.Lumertz

The lua code is attached.

It seems like you're having trouble getting Reaper to find the `mobdebug` module for debugging Lua scripts. Here's how you can set it up correctly:

## Setting Up MobDebug

1. **Install Lua Sockets and MobDebug**:
    - First, ensure you have Lua Sockets installed. You can download it via ReaPack or manually from GitHub repositories like [Daniel Lumertz's Lua Sockets](https://github.com/Daniel-Lumertz/Lua-Sockets).
    - For MobDebug, you can use ZeroBrane Studio's version or download it directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/pkulchenko/MobDebug).
2. **Configure Paths**:
    - You need to make sure Reaper can find `mobdebug.lua` and `luasocket`. You can do this by modifying the `package.path` and `package.cpath` in your script. Here's an example of how to do it:

```lua
-- Assuming mobdebug.lua and luasocket are in your Reaper scripts directory
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. reaper.GetResourcePath() .. '/Scripts/mobdebug/?.lua'
package.cpath = package.cpath .. ";" .. reaper.GetResourcePath() .. '/Scripts/luasocket/?.dll' -- For Windows
-- package.cpath = package.cpath .. ";" .. reaper.GetResourcePath() .. '/Scripts/luasocket/?.so' -- For Linux/macOS

require("mobdebug").start()
```

Make sure the paths are correct based on where you've placed `mobdebug.lua` and `luasocket`.
3. **Run the Script in Reaper**:
    - After setting up the paths, run your script in Reaper. If everything is configured correctly, VS Code should be able to connect and debug your script.
4. **Troubleshooting**:
    - If Reaper still can't find `mobdebug`, double-check that the paths are correct and that `mobdebug.lua` and `luasocket` are in the right locations.
    - Ensure that you have the latest versions of MobDebug and Lua Sockets.

## Additional Tips

- **Using VS Code**:
    - Make sure you have the Lua MobDebug extension installed in VS Code.
    - Configure your `launch.json` to listen for the MobDebug connection.
- **Debugging Issues**:
    - If you encounter crashes or issues while debugging, consider checking for version compatibility between Lua, MobDebug, and Lua Sockets[^2_7].

By following these steps, you should be able to set up MobDebug correctly and debug your Reaper Lua scripts in VS Code.

# I just want to understand the root cause before diving in deeper:  check my explanation for confusion, ambiguity, counter-factual etc:

Reaper uses lua as a scripting extension language. Reaper has statically compiled and linked the lua interpreter such that it does not include the binary core component needed by luasockets, and since mobdebug (a regular lua module with no direct binary dependency) depends on luasockets (which depends on core.dll/so), Daniel et. al. have hacked a workaround.

The workaround involves building a luasockets lib which includes the core binary pre-built.   So in addition to that bespoke luasockets lib, the user must also setup mobdebug within the Reaper search path so that it can find both dependencies when a script requires them, and the luasockets can load its own dll/shared object as needed.

And then... when the script starts and imports mobdebug, then a socket can be opened to connect to the vscode debugger.

Is that accurate?

Your explanation is mostly accurate, but there are a few nuances to clarify:

1. **Reaper's Lua Setup**:
    - Reaper embeds Lua as a scripting language but does so without including the full Lua auxiliary library (`lauxlib.h`), which is necessary for some external libraries like Lua Sockets to function properly[^3_2]. This limitation affects how external libraries can be used.
2. **Lua Sockets Dependency**:
    - Lua Sockets requires a binary component (`core.dll` or `core.so`) that interacts with the Lua interpreter. However, Reaper's embedded Lua lacks the necessary auxiliary library support, causing issues with loading these binaries[^3_2].
3. **Workaround for Lua Sockets**:
    - To circumvent this, developers like Daniel Lumertz have created custom builds of Lua Sockets that statically link the necessary Lua components. This allows Lua Sockets to work within Reaper by bypassing the limitations of Reaper's embedded Lua[^3_2].
4. **MobDebug Dependency**:
    - MobDebug is a Lua module that depends on Lua Sockets for networking capabilities. Since MobDebug itself doesn't have direct binary dependencies, it relies on Lua Sockets to establish connections for debugging[^3_3][^3_4].
5. **Setup for Debugging**:
    - To use MobDebug in Reaper, you need to:
        - Ensure the custom Lua Sockets library is available and configured correctly so it can load its binary components.
        - Place MobDebug within Reaper's Lua search path so it can be loaded by your scripts.
        - When your script requires MobDebug, it will use Lua Sockets to open a connection to the VS Code debugger.

Your explanation captures the essence of the issue and the workaround but could be refined slightly to reflect that the problem isn't just about static linking but also about Reaper's incomplete Lua setup affecting how external libraries like Lua Sockets are used.

Here's a refined version:

**Reaper** embeds Lua without the full auxiliary library support needed for some external libraries like **Lua Sockets**. To use **Lua Sockets** (and thus **MobDebug**), a custom build of Lua Sockets is required to bypass Reaper's limitations. This custom build allows Lua Sockets to load its necessary binary components. **MobDebug**, which depends on Lua Sockets for networking, can then be used to connect to a debugger like VS Code, provided it is placed in Reaper's Lua search path.

# Ok next bit:  the actual process to setup the workaround is pretty clumsy, poorly documented, and "unencapsulated" -- i.e. the different pieces of the puzzle come from different places and get set up manually and it's just very ugly.

What I want to do on Windows is to script as much of the setup as can be done, i.e. package both the missing modebug and luasockets components, auto-setup the placement of those into Reaper's chain, and pack both a hello-world lua script and a vscode project which verifies that the round trip works and debugging functions correctly.

The idea would be to use github actions to build a binary zip, and inside that we find one or more scripts (powershell probably) and both missing components and a vscode project skeleton.   Check that plan for technical feasability

Your plan to automate the setup of MobDebug and Lua Sockets for Reaper on Windows using GitHub Actions is technically feasible. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach this:

## Components Needed

1. **MobDebug and Lua Sockets**:
    - You need to package the custom Lua Sockets library (which includes the statically linked Lua core) and MobDebug.
    - Ensure that the Lua Sockets version is compatible with MobDebug.
2. **Reaper Setup Scripts**:
    - Create PowerShell scripts to automate the placement of MobDebug and Lua Sockets in Reaper's search path.
    - These scripts should also configure `package.path` and `package.cpath` for Lua scripts to find these libraries.
3. **Hello World Lua Script**:
    - Include a simple Lua script that uses MobDebug to test the setup.
4. **VS Code Project Skeleton**:
    - Create a basic VS Code project with a `launch.json` configuration for debugging Lua scripts using MobDebug.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Build Environment**:
    - Use GitHub Actions to set up a Windows environment.
    - Install necessary tools like Lua, Lua Sockets, and MobDebug.
2. **Custom Lua Sockets Build**:
    - Clone the Lua Sockets repository and build it with the statically linked Lua core.
    - Use tools like MSBuild for Windows.
3. **Package Components**:
    - Package MobDebug, custom Lua Sockets, PowerShell setup scripts, the hello-world Lua script, and the VS Code project skeleton into a binary zip.
4. **Automated Setup**:
    - Include PowerShell scripts in the zip that automate the setup process:
        - Copy MobDebug and Lua Sockets to the appropriate directories in Reaper.
        - Configure Reaper's Lua environment to use these libraries.
5. **Verification**:
    - Optionally, include a test script that runs the hello-world Lua script and verifies that debugging works as expected.

## Technical Feasibility

- **GitHub Actions**: You can use GitHub Actions to automate the build and packaging process. Windows environments are supported, allowing you to build and test your setup.
- **Custom Builds**: Building custom Lua Sockets with a statically linked Lua core is feasible using GitHub Actions.
- **Packaging and Deployment**: Packaging all components into a zip and including setup scripts is straightforward.


## Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Here's a simplified example of how your GitHub Actions workflow might look:

```yml
name: Build and Package Reaper Debugging Tools

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Lua and Lua Sockets
        run: |
          # Install Lua and necessary tools
          # Clone Lua Sockets repository and build it

      - name: Build Custom Lua Sockets
        run: |
          # Use MSBuild to build Lua Sockets with statically linked Lua core

      - name: Package Components
        run: |
          # Package MobDebug, custom Lua Sockets, setup scripts, hello-world script, and VS Code project
          # Create a zip file containing all components

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: reaper-debug-tools
          path: path/to/your/zipfile.zip
```

This workflow can be expanded to include all necessary steps for building and packaging your components.

## Conclusion

Your plan is technically feasible and can significantly simplify the setup process for users. By automating the build and packaging of necessary components, you can provide a streamlined experience for setting up MobDebug with Reaper on Windows.

# That's fine except I don't see a reason to rebuild the luasockets core binary:  Daniel's group is already doing that (also using github actions).   I just want the github actions so that when the upstream elements change, we detect that and build fresh stuff.

It seems like you want to automate the packaging of MobDebug and Lua Sockets for Reaper without rebuilding the Lua Sockets core binary, as Daniel's group is already handling that. Here's how you can set up a GitHub Actions workflow to achieve this:

## Workflow Overview

1. **Trigger**: Set up the workflow to trigger on changes to your repository or when upstream components change (e.g., new releases of MobDebug or Lua Sockets).
2. **Environment**: Use a Windows environment since you're targeting Reaper on Windows.
3. **Checkout Code**: Use the `actions/checkout` action to fetch your repository code.
4. **Download Components**:
    - Download the pre-built Lua Sockets library from Daniel's repository or releases.
    - Download MobDebug from its repository.
5. **Package Components**:
    - Package MobDebug, the pre-built Lua Sockets library, PowerShell setup scripts, a hello-world Lua script, and a VS Code project skeleton into a binary zip.
6. **Upload Artifact**:
    - Use `actions/upload-artifact` to upload the zip file as an artifact.

## Example Workflow YAML

Here's a simplified example of how your GitHub Actions workflow might look:

```yml
name: Package Reaper Debugging Tools

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # Optionally, add triggers for upstream repository changes

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Download Lua Sockets
        run: |
          # Use curl or wget to download the pre-built Lua Sockets library
          # Example:
          curl -LO https://github.com/daniellumertz/mavriq-lua-sockets-testingnewlua/releases/download/latest/luasockets.zip
          unzip luasockets.zip

      - name: Download MobDebug
        run: |
          # Use curl or wget to download MobDebug
          # Example:
          curl -LO https://github.com/pkulchenko/MobDebug/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
          unzip master.zip

      - name: Package Components
        run: |
          # Create a zip file containing MobDebug, Lua Sockets, setup scripts, hello-world script, and VS Code project
          # Example:
          mkdir package
          cp -r mobdebug-master/* package/
          cp -r luasockets/* package/
          cp setup.ps1 package/
          cp hello.lua package/
          cp -r vscode-project package/
          zip -r reaper-debug-tools.zip package

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: reaper-debug-tools
          path: reaper-debug-tools.zip
```


## Monitoring Upstream Changes

To detect changes in upstream components, you can use GitHub Actions' `repository_dispatch` event or manually check for updates in your workflow. However, directly triggering a workflow based on changes in another repository is not straightforward with GitHub Actions. You might need to use a scheduled job to periodically check for updates or rely on manual triggers.

## Conclusion

Your approach is feasible and can simplify the process of packaging and distributing MobDebug and Lua Sockets for Reaper users. By leveraging pre-built components and automating the packaging process, you can ensure that users have access to the latest versions without needing to rebuild everything from scratch.

# I'm surprised that the upstream change detection in Github Actions is a point of friction.  Shouldn't that be one of the star features of a CI platform designed and implemented by Github itself?

You're right to expect robust upstream change detection in GitHub Actions, given GitHub's expertise in version control and CI/CD. However, there are some limitations and nuances to consider:

1. **Repository Triggers**: GitHub Actions primarily triggers workflows based on events within the same repository, such as push, pull requests, or issues. It doesn't natively support triggering workflows based on changes in other repositories unless those changes are explicitly linked to your repository (e.g., through a pull request or a repository dispatch event).
2. **Workarounds**: To detect changes in upstream repositories, you can use a few workarounds:
    - **Scheduled Jobs**: Run a scheduled job (e.g., daily) that checks for updates in upstream repositories. This can be done by fetching the latest commit hashes or release versions and comparing them to the previous ones.
    - **Repository Dispatch**: If you have write access to the upstream repository, you can use a repository dispatch event to trigger your workflow. However, this requires cooperation from the maintainers of the upstream repository.
    - **Webhooks**: If the upstream repository supports webhooks (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), you can set up a webhook to trigger your workflow when changes occur. However, this typically requires external services to forward the webhook to GitHub Actions.
3. **Future Developments**: GitHub continuously improves GitHub Actions, so it's possible that better support for upstream change detection might be added in the future.

For now, using scheduled jobs or manual checks is a common approach to handle upstream changes in GitHub Actions workflows.

Here's an example of how you might implement a scheduled job to check for updates:

```yml
name: Check for Upstream Updates

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * * # Run daily at midnight

jobs:
  check-updates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Check for Lua Sockets updates
        run: |
          # Fetch latest Lua Sockets release version
          latest_version=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/daniellumertz/mavriq-lua-sockets-testingnewlua/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name')
          # Compare with stored version
          if [ "$latest_version" != "$(cat stored_version.txt)" ]; then
            echo "Update detected. Triggering build..."
            # Trigger build workflow here
          fi
```

This approach requires storing the current version and comparing it with the latest version fetched from the upstream repository. If an update is detected, you can trigger a build workflow to package the new versions.

# With regard to the mobdebug setup for reaper, what is the essential piece?  Is it a single lua script or a packaged directory?  What would be the most reliable path to resolving that dependency?

The essential piece for setting up MobDebug in Reaper involves ensuring that both **MobDebug** and **Lua Sockets** are accessible to your script. Here's what you need:

1. **MobDebug**:
    - **MobDebug** itself is a single Lua script (`mobdebug.lua`). You need to place this file in a location where Reaper can find it, typically within your Reaper scripts directory.
2. **Lua Sockets**:
    - **Lua Sockets** is a package that includes both Lua scripts and a binary component (`core.dll` or `core.so`). For Reaper, you need a custom build of Lua Sockets that includes the necessary binary components pre-built, as Reaper's embedded Lua doesn't support loading external binaries in the standard way.
3. **Reliable Path to Resolving Dependencies**:
    - **Place `mobdebug.lua`** in your Reaper scripts directory or a subdirectory within it.
    - **Use a custom Lua Sockets build** that includes the necessary binary components. Ensure that both the Lua scripts and the binary (`core.dll` or `core.so`) are in the correct locations.
    - **Modify `package.path` and `package.cpath`** in your script to include the paths to `mobdebug.lua` and the Lua Sockets binary, respectively.

Here's an example of how you might set up these paths in your script:

```lua
-- Assuming mobdebug.lua is in Scripts/mobdebug and Lua Sockets is in Scripts/Lua Sockets
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. reaper.GetResourcePath() .. '/Scripts/mobdebug/?.lua'
package.cpath = package.cpath .. ";" .. reaper.GetResourcePath() .. '/Scripts/Lua Sockets/?.dll' -- For Windows
-- package.cpath = package.cpath .. ";" .. reaper.GetResourcePath() .. '/Scripts/Lua Sockets/?.so' -- For Linux/macOS

require("mobdebug").start()
```

This setup ensures that both MobDebug and Lua Sockets are accessible to your script, allowing you to use MobDebug for remote debugging in Reaper.
